## So the RESTful stuff gets me access to the core datasets in a uniprot centered way.

http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=organism:9606+AND+database:pdb&format=tab&columns=id,database(PDB)

## modify it to have the pfam and prosite (and ipi?) IDs matched to entrez genes

## I can get everything from human uniprot like this
http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=organism:9606&format=tab

## OR I can get everything from human uniref like this etc.
http://www.uniprot.org/uniref/?query=organism:9606&format=tab

## OR I can get everything from human uniparc like this etc.
http://www.uniprot.org/uniparc/?query=organism:9606&format=tab

## OR from subcellular locations like this (very slow):
http://www.uniprot.org/locations/?query=organism:9606&format=tab


## etc.  


## There is additional information here about how to query the
##   sub-fields for the different DBs.  So for example, I think that you
##   should be able to get the PFAM IDs matched with the Accession IDs
##   this way...

http://www.uniprot.org/help/query-fields


## So for example, to get all the PFAM data matched to uniprot I should be able to do it like this:

http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=organism:9606+AND+database:pdb&format=tab&columns=id,database(PFAM)


## And then also for prosite I can do a similar thing:

http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=organism:9606+AND+database:pdb&format=tab&columns=id,database%28prosite%29

## or (probably better) like this:
http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=organism:9606&format=tab&columns=id,database(prosite)

## OR maybe it should be like this (except this doesn't give me the data I wanted...
http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=organism:9606+AND+database:prosite&format=tab



##############################################

I can indeed use the REST interface for the ID mapping, (but there will be limits for really large queries should be less than 100K entries)

This page:
http://www.uniprot.org/help/mapping

Gives this example (for how to lookup one ID type from another)
http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=%22interpro+IPR014000%22+or+%22interpro+IPR014002%22+or+%22interpro+IPR014003%22&format=tab&columns=id,database(interpro)

But notice that the example shows some of the limitations.  I have to put all the IDs into a pretty long URL (there are limits on that), and then my return value may have extra vals in it that need to be tidied (it is just column subsetted to get back matching rows).


OR I have to use a programmatic API for perl python, java or ruby???  OR (maybe) I can just use something like RCurl to get and post to the service???  - This works (pretty well actually).




OR for the ID mapping I can just DL the dataset myself (IOW the usual -> make a DB etc.)

Then there is also the blast like search capability which they offer a service for as well, but I don't think it allows programatic access??? (this is a whole other ball of wax)
