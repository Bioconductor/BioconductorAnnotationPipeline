## This script is only called during the build stage - not download or parse.
## The code adds PFAM, Prosite and IPI data to the human, rat, chicken, 
## zebrafish, mouse and bovine chipsrc_*.sqlite files and PFAM only to
## chipsrc_yeast.sqlite.
## 
## PFAM and Prosite data are downloaded with UniProt.ws and IPI data are 
## taken from the old chipsrc_* files from the last build; this transfer
## of stale data has been going on for some time - the IPI database was 
## closed in 2011.
