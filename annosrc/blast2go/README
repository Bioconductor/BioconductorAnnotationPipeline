April 2017:

Scripts in the blast2go/ directory are only run in the build stage - not
download or parse. At some point the change was made to get the data from the
UniProt site instead of the blast2go site. Data are now downloaded from UniProt
and processed on-the-fly in the byPassBlast2GoAndInsteadUseUniProt.R script.
